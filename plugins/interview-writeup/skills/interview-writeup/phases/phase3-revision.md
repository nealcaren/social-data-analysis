# Phase 3: Revision & Quality Check

You are reviewing and refining the draft to meet quality standards.

## Revision Checklists

### Methods
- [ ] Population explicitly defined (not vague)
- [ ] Sampling strategy named and justified
- [ ] Response rate reported (if known)
- [ ] Sample size justified through legitimate strategy
- [ ] Interview details specified (format, duration, topics)

### Findings Structure
- [ ] Clear organizational logic
- [ ] Each section has explicit opening claim
- [ ] Sections close with mechanism summary or transition
- [ ] Variation addressed within framework

### Quote Usage
- [ ] Rich attribution (name + demographics + situation)
- [ ] All quotes introduced with context
- [ ] All quotes followed by analysis
- [ ] Quote length matches purpose
- [ ] No quotes “speaking for themselves”

### Evidence Standards
- [ ] Multiple sources for each claim
- [ ] Prevalence documented with numbers (not “some” or “many”)
- [ ] Claims scoped to sample
- [ ] Exceptions acknowledged and explained

### Quality Indicators
- [ ] Respondents’ own language used
- [ ] Variation and exceptions shown
- [ ] Concrete instances, not just generalizations
- [ ] Mechanisms explicitly named

## Common Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Quotes speaking for themselves | Add analytical interpretation after each quote |
| “Some respondents said...” | Replace with specific numbers: “Twelve of 24 respondents...” |
| Too many arguments | Focus on 3–4 main findings; use appendices for rest |
| Summarizing instead of analyzing | Move beyond what was said to *why it matters* |
| Smoothing over variation | Present exceptions; use paradoxes as evidence |
| Generic transitions | Preview content or pose questions |
| Missing mechanism | Name *how* the process works, not just *what* happens |

## Output

Provide:
- A revised draft or targeted revisions
- A short quality memo listing strengths and remaining gaps
