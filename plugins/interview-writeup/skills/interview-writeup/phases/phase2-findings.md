# Phase 2: Findings Section

You are structuring and drafting the findings section, using quotes as evidence and naming mechanisms clearly.

## Why This Phase Matters

A strong findings section moves beyond description to explanation. Structure and evidence selection determine clarity and credibility.

## Choose an Organizational Template

### Template 1: Paired Case Study
**Best for**: Explaining why similar people end up in different places

```
OPENING FRAME
├── Establish shared starting point
├── Signal divergence
└── Preview organization

CASE A: POSITIVE PATHWAY
├── Character introduction (name, demographics, situation)
├── Quotes showing their approach
└── Outcome: success/satisfaction

CASE B: CONSTRAINED PATHWAY
├── Character introduction (“Unlike Case A...”)
├── Quotes showing different circumstances
└── Outcome: struggle/dissatisfaction

SYNTHESIS
├── Direct comparison
├── Mechanism explanation
└── Additional evidence from other respondents
```

### Template 2: Mechanism-Based
**Best for**: Showing how processes or power operate

```
OPENING FRAME
├── Main finding with scope statement
└── Preview mechanisms (“We highlight two prominent ways...”)

MECHANISM 1
├── Definition/framing
├── Case showing problem
├── Case showing intervention/response
└── Explicit mechanism naming

MECHANISM 2
└── [Same structure]

INTEGRATION
├── How mechanisms combine
└── Cumulative effect
```

### Template 3: Comparative-Typological
**Best for**: Cross-group or cross-context analysis

```
OPENING FRAME
├── What groups share
├── Key divergence
└── Categorical framework: (1)..., (2)..., (3)...

GROUP A
├── Category 1: pattern + quotes
├── Category 2: pattern + quotes
└── Group A summary

GROUP B
├── Contrast transition (“Unlike Group A...”)
└── [Parallel structure]

EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCE
├── “How might we explain...?”
├── Institutional/structural mechanism
└── Evidence

CONVERGENCE (if applicable)
├── Shared pattern despite divergence
└── Why this convergence exists
```

## Quote Usage Guidance

### Quote Length by Purpose

| Purpose | Length | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Language patterns | 2–4 words embedded | described feeling “stuck between a rock and a hard place” |
| Reasoning/decision-making | 3–6 lines | Medium block quote |
| Full narrative with context | 8–15 lines | Extended block quote |

### Quote Introduction Template

Always use rich attribution:

```
[Name], a [demographic characteristics] in [situation], explained:

> [Quote]
```

### Quote Clusters

When showing parallel patterns, present 2–3 short quotes and analyze collectively:

```
Multiple respondents described similar experiences. [Name 1] noted: "[brief quote]."
[Name 2] similarly observed: "[brief quote]." And [Name 3] explained: "[brief quote]."

What is striking across these accounts is [collective analysis].
```

### Analysis After Quotes

Every quote (or quote cluster) needs analytical follow-up:

```
[Quote]

[Name]’s characterization of [institution] as [descriptor] illustrates
[mechanism]. [He/She/They] believes that [specific interpretation], which
demonstrates [connection to broader argument].
```

## Scope Statements

Encourage repeated scope statements:
- “Across both sites...”
- “Among the majority of participants...”
- “Regardless of [demographic variation]...”
- “The pattern held whether [condition A] or [condition B]...”

## Handling Variation

Use paradoxes strategically:

```
While [mechanism] affected even our most [advantaged] respondents,
[disadvantaged group] experienced [even greater impact]. Notably,
participants with [expected solution] expressed these sentiments
alongside those without. In other words, [expected solution] was
*not* sufficient because [structural mechanism explanation].
```

## Section Transitions

**Weak**: “Next, we turn to...”

**Strong**: “How might we explain these different patterns? Our data point toward...”

**Weak**: “We now discuss...”

**Strong**: “While participants diverged on [X], there were important points of connection...”

## Mechanism Naming

Encourage explicit mechanism statements, often italicized:

```
*Rather than bringing participants together to bargain collectively,
we found that private participation individualized access to information.*
```

## Output

Provide a findings outline or draft that includes:
- Clear section structure
- Claims tied to evidence
- Rich attribution
- Explicit mechanisms and scope statements

## When You’re Done

Return a summary to the orchestrator with:
1. Chosen template and rationale
2. Drafted sections or outline
3. Gaps in evidence or missing quotes
