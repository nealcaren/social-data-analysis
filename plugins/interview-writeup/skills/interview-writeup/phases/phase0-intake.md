# Phase 0: Intake & Scope

You are executing Phase 0 of the interview write-up workflow. Your goal is to confirm required inputs, clarify scope, and plan the writing task.

## Why This Phase Matters

A strong write-up depends on clear claims, structured evidence, and transparent methods. Missing inputs create weak or generic prose.

## Required Inputs

Ask users to provide the following materials before drafting.

### Required

| Document | What to Include | Why Needed |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Main argument** | 1–2 sentence statement of the core finding or claim | To recommend structure and maintain focus |
| **Participant table** | Pseudonyms, key demographics (age, race/ethnicity, gender, class, role), any characteristics relevant to analysis | For accurate, rich attribution in quotes |
| **Main findings** | 3–4 findings they want to present, with brief descriptions | To structure the findings section |
| **Selected quotes** | Key quotes organized by finding, with speaker identified | The evidence to work with |

### Required for Methods Section

| Document | What to Include | Why Needed |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Methods notes** | N, dates, location, target population, sampling strategy, recruitment method, response rate (if known), interview format/duration, recording/transcription approach, analysis method | To draft accurate methods section |

### Highly Useful

| Document | What to Include | Why Needed |

| **Draft outline or partial draft** | Current structure or existing text | To build on their work |
| **Variation/exceptions notes** | Cases that don't fit the main pattern | To address heterogeneity |

### Optional but Helpful

| Document | What to Include | Why Needed |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Target journal** | Journal name or sample article | To calibrate length and style |
| **Literature context** | Key theoretical frameworks or debates | To connect findings to field |
| **Full transcripts** | Complete interview transcripts | To find additional quotes or check context |

### Quote Organization

```
## Finding 1: [Title]

**Claim**: [One sentence stating the finding]

**Quote 1** (Helen):
"[Quote text]"
Context: [When/why this was said]

**Quote 2** (Marcus):
"[Quote text]"
Context: [When/why this was said]

**Variation/Exception** (Vanessa):
"[Quote showing different pattern]"
Context: [Why this case differs]
```

## Clarify Scope

Ask:
- Are we working on **methods**, **findings**, or **both**?
- Is this **drafting from scratch** or **revising** existing text?
- What is the **target journal** or audience, if any?

## Output

Provide a short intake memo that includes:

- Agreed scope and deliverables
- Proposed findings structure (if enough info is available)

## When You’re Done

Return a summary to the orchestrator with:
1. Which inputs were provided
2. Missing inputs to request
3. Agreed scope (methods/findings/both)
4. Recommended structure approach if appropriate
