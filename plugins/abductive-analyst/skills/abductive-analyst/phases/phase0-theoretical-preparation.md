# Phase 0: Theoretical Preparation

You are executing Phase 0 of an abductive analysis. Your goal is to develop the theoretical sensitivity necessary to recognize surprises in the data. Following Timmermans and Tavory, abductive analysis requires "extensive familiarity with existing theories at the outset and throughout every research step."

## Why This Phase Matters

Abduction depends on recognizing anomalies against a background of theoretical expectations. You can only see something as surprising if you have expectations to be surprised about. This phase builds those expectations.

As Timmermans & Tavory note: "The theoretical analysis... emerged out of empirical contradictions generated by in-depth familiarity with existing theories."

## Your Tasks

### 1. Read and Synthesize the Theory Literature

Read all materials in the `/theory` folder carefully. For each text, extract:

**Core concepts and definitions**
- What are the key theoretical constructs?
- How are they defined and operationalized?

**Mechanisms and processes**
- What causal mechanisms does the theory propose?
- What processes does it describe?

**Predictions and expectations**
- What would this theory predict we should find in the phenomenon under study?
- What patterns should be present? What should be absent?

**Scope conditions and limitations**
- What contexts does the theory apply to?
- What does it explicitly NOT explain?

### 2. Distinguish Map and Compass Theories

Following Timmermans & Tavory's distinction:

**Map theories** (substantive/middle-range): Theories specific to the subfield of your phenomenon
- What do these say about participation, adoption, or engagement processes (as relevant)?
- What do they say about sustained involvement over time (as relevant)?
- What are the key debates and tensions within this literature?

**Compass theories** (grammatical): Broader theories of social life that inform how we understand action
- What compass theories have affinity with your topic?
- Consider: symbolic interactionism, emotions and affect, collective identity, practice theory, biographical approaches

### 3. Map the Theoretical Terrain

Create a synthetic overview that includes:

**Key concepts across theories**
- Networks and social ties
- Identity and belonging
- Emotions and moral evaluation
- Resources, constraints, and opportunities
- Organizational or institutional dynamics
- Etc. (based on what you find in the literature)

**Points of convergence**
- Where do different theories agree?

**Points of tension and debate**
- Where do theories conflict or emphasize different factors?
- These are potential sites for theoretical contribution

**Gaps and silences**
- What phenomena are poorly explained by existing theory?
- What questions remain unanswered?

### 4. Generate Sensitizing Questions

Based on your synthesis, generate questions to bring to the data. These are NOT hypotheses to test, but lenses for recognizing surprises.

**What should we expect to find?**
- Based on the literature, what should participation or engagement look like in your case?
- What pathways into the phenomenon would existing theory predict?
- What factors should sustain commitment?

**What would be surprising?**
- What findings would NOT fit the existing theories?
- What would contradict or complicate the dominant accounts?
- Where might your case be distinctive in ways existing theory doesn't capture?

**What should we pay attention to?**
- What specific aspects of the oral histories might reveal tensions with existing theory?
- What questions should guide our reading of the interviews?

### 5. Consider the Focal Case Context

Note any ways the focal case might challenge standard theories in your area:
- Contextual shocks or crises
- Distinctive organizational forms or institutional arrangements
- Unusual participant composition or roles
- Intersection of multiple domains (e.g., health, politics, identity)
- Salient emotions or moral stakes

## Output Files to Create

Save all outputs to `/analysis/phase0-reports/`:

1. **theory-summaries.md** - Summary of each theoretical text with extracted concepts, mechanisms, predictions, and limitations

2. **theoretical-map.md** - Synthetic overview of the field including:
   - Key concepts and their relationships
   - Map theories (substantive debates in participation literature)
   - Compass theories (broader frameworks with affinity to the topic)
   - Points of convergence and tension
   - Gaps and silences

3. **sensitizing-questions.md** - Questions to bring to the data:
   - What existing theories predict
   - What would constitute surprises
   - Specific aspects to attend to

4. **phase0-report.md** - Executive summary for the user including:
   - Overview of the theoretical literature reviewed
   - Key insights from the synthesis
   - Most promising areas for potential theoretical contribution
   - Recommended sensitizing questions for Phase 1
   - Questions for the user about theoretical priorities

## Guiding Principles

1. **Breadth over depth initially**: Survey the full range of theoretical perspectives before diving deep into any one.

2. **Theories as tools, not tests**: We're not trying to confirm or disconfirm theories. We're building sensitivity to recognize what's interesting.

3. **Embrace pluralism**: Multiple theoretical frameworks reveal different aspects of the same phenomenon. Don't commit too early.

4. **Gaps are opportunities**: What existing theories DON'T explain well is where theoretical innovation happens.

5. **Stay empirically oriented**: Keep asking "What would this look like in the data?"

## Example Format for Theory Summary

```markdown
## [Text Title]

**Core Argument**: [1-2 sentence summary]

**Key Concepts**:
- Concept 1: [definition]
- Concept 2: [definition]

**Mechanisms**:
- [How does participation happen according to this theory?]

**Predictions for [Focal Case]**:
- [What would we expect to find if this theory is right?]

**Limitations/Gaps**:
- [What doesn't this theory explain?]

**Potential Tensions**:
- [How might your case challenge this theory?]
```
