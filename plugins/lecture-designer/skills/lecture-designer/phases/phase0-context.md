# Phase 0: Context & Learning Outcomes

You are executing Phase 0 of the lecture design process. Your goal is to understand the teaching context and establish clear, measurable learning outcomes before any content design begins.

## Why This Phase Matters

Backward design is the foundation of effective instruction. You must know where students should end up before you can plan how to get them there. Learning outcomes aren't just administrative requirements—they're the criteria against which every design decision will be evaluated.

As Wiggins and McTighe emphasize: "Begin with the end in mind."

## Your Tasks

### 1. Gather Context

Clarify the teaching situation:

**Course & Audience**
- What course is this? (Level, department, prerequisites)
- How many students?
- What's their prior knowledge base?
- Are there known struggles or misconceptions?

**Logistics**
- How much time is available? (50 min, 75 min, 90 min?)
- What technology is available? (Polling system, projection, etc.)
- Is this in-person, hybrid, or online?

**Instructor Preferences**
- What teaching style does the instructor prefer?
- Are there activities they love or hate?
- Any constraints or requirements?

### 2. Review the Source Material

Read the chapter/reading material carefully:
- What are the main concepts?
- What's the logical structure?
- What vocabulary is introduced?
- What are the key examples or applications?

### 3. Review Instructor Notes

If the instructor has provided notes:
- What do they want to emphasize?
- What do they typically struggle to teach?
- What questions do students usually ask?
- Are there "war stories" or examples they want to include?

### 4. Define Learning Outcomes

Write 3-5 measurable learning outcomes using action verbs:

**Good outcomes are:**
- **Specific**: Not "understand X" but "explain the mechanism of X"
- **Measurable**: You can assess whether students achieved it
- **Achievable**: Realistic for the time and level
- **Aligned**: Connected to course goals and assessment

**Use Bloom's verbs appropriately:**
- Remember: define, list, identify, name
- Understand: explain, summarize, classify, compare
- Apply: use, demonstrate, solve, calculate
- Analyze: differentiate, distinguish, examine, contrast
- Evaluate: assess, justify, critique, defend
- Create: design, construct, develop, formulate

**Example outcomes:**
- "By the end of this lecture, students will be able to explain the three main causes of X using concrete examples."
- "Students will be able to apply the [concept] to diagnose problems in novel cases."
- "Students will be able to compare and contrast approaches A and B, identifying when each is appropriate."

### 5. Define Evidence of Learning

For each outcome, specify how you'll know students achieved it:
- Which poll question tests this outcome?
- What would students need to say/do/produce?
- How will you check understanding during the lecture?

### 6. Identify Potential Challenges

Flag issues that will affect design:
- Concepts that require heavy prior knowledge
- Material that's known to be confusing
- Time constraints that limit coverage
- Technology limitations

## Output Files to Create

Save all outputs to the appropriate location:

1. **context-memo.md** - Course context, audience, logistics, constraints

2. **learning-outcomes.md** - Include:
   - 3-5 measurable learning outcomes
   - Evidence plan for each outcome
   - Connection to course-level goals

3. **content-overview.md** - Summary of:
   - Main concepts in the chapter
   - Instructor emphases
   - Known student difficulties
   - Potential challenges

4. **phase0-report.md** - Executive summary including:
   - Key context facts
   - Proposed learning outcomes
   - Initial thoughts on challenges
   - Questions for the instructor

## Guiding Principles

1. **Less is more**: 3-5 outcomes, not 15. If everything is essential, nothing is.

2. **Verbs matter**: "Understand" is unmeasurable. "Explain," "apply," "compare" are testable.

3. **The instructor knows their students**: Their notes about struggles and misconceptions are gold.

4. **Time is fixed**: The outcomes must be achievable in the available time.

5. **Alignment is everything**: Outcomes → Activities → Assessment must match.

## When You're Done

Return a summary to the orchestrator that includes:
1. Confirmation that all files were created
2. The proposed learning outcomes
3. Key context that will affect design (time, size, constraints)
4. Any questions for the instructor before proceeding
5. Recommended focus for Phase 1 (what content areas are most critical)
