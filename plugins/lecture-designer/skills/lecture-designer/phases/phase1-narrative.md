# Phase 1: Content Audit & Narrative Design

You are executing Phase 1 of the lecture design process. Your goal is to transform the chapter content into a compelling narrative arc, cutting ruthlessly to focus on what's essential.

## Why This Phase Matters

A lecture is not a spoken textbook. The textbook is a reference repository; the lecture is a narrative experience. Students can read definitions on their own. What they need from a live lecture is expert modeling, cognitive engagement, and the "story" of the ideas.

As the overview notes: "The goal is to move beyond the 'coverage' model toward a 'constructivist' model where the lecture serves as a scaffold for students to build their own mental models."

## Inputs

Before starting, read:
1. Phase 0 outputs (learning outcomes, context memo)
2. The chapter/reading material
3. Instructor notes

## Your Tasks

### 1. Content Audit

Go through the chapter systematically and categorize every section:

| Category | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Essential** | Core concepts, foundational theories, mechanisms that require expert modeling | Focus 80% of lecture time here |
| **Helpful** | Supporting examples, interesting side-notes, granular data | Cut from lecture; suggest as optional reading |
| **Decorative** | Tangential anecdotes, excessive background | Eliminate entirely |

**The Hard Rule**: If you mark everything as essential, you've failed the audit. A 75-minute lecture can cover 3-4 major concepts well, not 12.

**Create an audit table:**
```markdown
| Section/Topic | Category | Rationale | Time Estimate |
|---------------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| [Topic 1] | Essential | Required for outcome #1 | 15 min |
| [Topic 2] | Helpful | Good example but not core | Cut |
| [Topic 3] | Essential | Hardest concept, needs modeling | 15 min |
```

### 2. Design the Narrative Arc (ABT Framework)

Transform the content from a list into a story using And-But-Therefore:

**AND (The Setup)**
- What's the context students already know?
- What's the "normal world" before the concept?
- "We know X is true, AND we know Y is true..."

**BUT (The Conflict)**
- What's the problem, paradox, or gap?
- What contradiction or puzzle exists?
- "...BUT there's a problem. X and Y seem to conflict."
- This creates a "knowledge gap" the brain wants to close.

**THEREFORE (The Resolution)**
- How does the lecture content resolve the tension?
- What's the new understanding?
- "...THEREFORE, we need this new concept/framework/tool."

### 3. Design the Hook

The first 60 seconds determine engagement for the whole lecture. Design an opening that:

**Effective hooks:**
- Present a mystery or puzzle
- Show an unexpected observation
- Ask a prediction question
- Present a paradox that existing knowledge can't explain
- Tell a story that ends in a cliffhanger

**Hook structure:**
- State the mystery/problem (30 sec)
- Baseline poll: "What do you think explains this?" (30 sec)
- Promise: "By minute 75, you'll have the tools to solve this."

**Examples by discipline:**
- Biology: "Why can this lizard walk on water while this one sinks?"
- History: "This one diplomatic cable could have prevented WWI. Why was it ignored?"
- Economics: "These two countries have identical resources. Why is one wealthy and one poor?"
- Sociology: "This community has lower crime despite higher poverty. What's different?"

### 4. Create the Chunk Map

Break the lecture into 3-4 chunks of approximately 15 minutes each:

**Template for 75 minutes:**
```
HOOK (5 min)
- The mystery/paradox
- Baseline poll

CHUNK 1: [Topic] (15 min)
- Key concept(s)
- Supports outcome #__
- → Active break (5 min): ConcepTest

CHUNK 2: [Topic] (15 min)
- Key concept(s) - typically the hardest material
- Supports outcome #__
- → Active break (5 min): State change

CHUNK 3: [Topic] (10 min)
- Application/implications
- Supports outcome #__
- → Synthesis activity (10 min)

SUMMARY (5 min)
- Return to hook
- Resolve the mystery

REFLECTION (5 min)
- Muddiest point
- Next steps
```

### 5. Convert Headings to Plot Points

Don't use textbook headings. Rename sections to emphasize action and tension:

| Textbook Heading | Lecture Plot Point |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "The Krebs Cycle" | "The Energy Crisis: How Cells Extract Value from Waste" |
| "Treaty of Versailles" | "The Peace that Failed: Seeds of a New Conflict" |
| "Supply and Demand" | "The Invisible Hand: Why Prices Move Without Anyone Deciding" |
| "Social Capital" | "The Hidden Currency: Why Who You Know Matters" |

## Output Files to Create

1. **content-audit.md** - Complete audit table with categorizations and rationale

2. **narrative-arc.md** - Including:
   - AND section (setup)
   - BUT section (conflict/puzzle)
   - THEREFORE section (resolution)
   - Connection to learning outcomes

3. **hook-design.md** - Including:
   - The opening mystery/problem
   - Baseline poll question
   - Promise statement
   - Backup hook options

4. **chunk-map.md** - Complete timeline with:
   - Topic for each chunk
   - Time allocation
   - Learning outcome alignment
   - Active break placement

5. **phase1-report.md** - Executive summary including:
   - What was cut and why
   - The narrative structure
   - The hook
   - Recommended chunk sequence
   - Questions for instructor

## Guiding Principles

1. **Cut is the hardest word**: Every topic you include means less time for others. Be ruthless.

2. **Tension drives attention**: The "BUT" creates cognitive tension that keeps students engaged.

3. **The hook is not optional**: A strong opening determines engagement for 75 minutes.

4. **Chunk by concept, not by clock**: Each chunk should be a coherent idea, not an arbitrary time block.

5. **Return to the hook**: The lecture should "close the loop" by resolving the opening mystery.

## When You're Done

Return a summary to the orchestrator that includes:
1. Confirmation that all files were created
2. What was cut from the chapter (and why)
3. The proposed narrative arc (ABT summary)
4. The hook concept
5. The chunk map with timing
6. Any concerns about time or coverage
7. Questions for the instructor about priorities
