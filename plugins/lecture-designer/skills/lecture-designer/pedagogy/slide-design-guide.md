# Slide Design Guide: Evidence-Based Best Practices

This guide distills principles from Nancy Duarte's *slide:ology* and *DataStory*, Garr Reynolds' *Presentation Zen*, and Carmine Gallo's *Talk Like TED*.

## Core Philosophy

### The Fundamental Shift
Slides are **visual aids**, not documents. They support the speaker—they don't replace them.

> "If a slide contains more than 75 words, it has become a document, not a presentation." — Nancy Duarte

> "No more than 6 words on a slide. EVER." — Seth Godin

**The problem**: Audiences cannot read and listen simultaneously. When you show text-heavy slides, they read instead of listening to you.

**The solution**: Use slides as a visual backdrop that amplifies your narrative, not as a teleprompter.

## The Numbers That Matter

| Rule | Source | Application |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **75-word limit** | Duarte | More than 75 words = it's a document |
| **6-word rule** | Godin/Reynolds | Aim for 6 words or fewer per slide |
| **3-second test** | Duarte | Audiences must grasp content within 3 seconds |
| **18-minute rule** | TED | Ideal presentation length; cognitive overload after |
| **10-minute soft breaks** | Gallo | If longer than 18 min, break every 10 minutes |
| **Rule of Three** | Gallo | Organize around 3 key messages |
| **28pt minimum** | Duarte | Minimum font size for keynotes |
| **65% stories** | Stevenson | Top TED talks are 65% stories, not data |

## Visual Design Principles

### The CRAP Framework (Reynolds)
Four principles that make slides visually effective:

**1. Contrast**
- Make different things VERY different
- Create clear focal points through size, color, weight
- Use the "smallest effective difference"—just notable, no more

**2. Repetition**
- Consistent backgrounds, typography, colors throughout
- Creates unity and professionalism
- Audiences know what to expect

**3. Alignment**
- Every element connects via invisible grid lines
- Nothing should look randomly placed
- Use grid systems (5x5 is common)

**4. Proximity**
- Group related items together
- Separate unrelated items
- Viewers assume items near each other are related

### Signal-to-Noise Ratio
Higher signal = cleaner design. Remove:
- Unnecessary logos (keep only on first/last slide)
- Decorative backgrounds that compete with content
- 3D effects on charts (distorts data)
- Gradient fills and drop shadows
- Gridlines in charts (unless essential)
- Clip art (always)

### Empty Space (Negative Space)
- Empty space is a powerful design element, not wasted space
- Gives slides "visual breathing room"
- Implies elegance and sophistication
- If you need to sacrifice whitespace, split into multiple slides

## Typography Rules

### Font Selection
- **Sans-serif for projection** (Helvetica, Arial, Calibri)—clearer at distance
- **Maximum 2 fonts**: one for headlines, one for body
- Use color or italics for emphasis, not additional fonts
- Avoid decorative fonts that reduce legibility

### Size Guidelines
- **Headlines**: 32pt or larger
- **Body text**: 28pt minimum for keynotes
- **Never below 24pt** (if you need smaller, you have a document)
- **Test**: Can you read it at 66% zoom in slide sorter view?

### Text Formatting
- Left alignment is standard (easier to read)
- Avoid ALL CAPS for more than a few words
- Watch line spacing—tight spacing reduces readability
- Avoid widows (single words on last line)

## Image Best Practices

### Photo Selection
- Use high-quality, professional images
- Build a cohesive "family" of images (similar lighting, color tones)
- Avoid cheesy staged stock photography
- Ensure images reflect your audience's culture/context
- Use rule of thirds for composition

### Full-Bleed Images
- Make images fill the entire screen
- Creates cinematic, immersive effect
- Allow images to bleed off edges—brain fills in the rest
- Pair with minimal overlaid text (high contrast)

### The Picture Superiority Effect
- Hear information → remember 10% after 3 days
- Add a picture → remember 65% after 3 days
- **Images help you remember 6x more than words alone**

### Direction and Gaze
- If showing people, have them looking toward your content, not away
- Use directional elements (arrows, pointing, eye gaze) to guide attention
- Place subjects intentionally—top = dominant, isolated = more weight

## Data Visualization

### Chart Selection
Stick with charts everyone understands:

| Chart Type | Use When | Observation Language |
|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Bar charts** | Comparing static values | Adjectives: "higher," "significant," "dramatic" |
| **Pie charts** | Showing parts of whole | Adjectives: "majority," "substantial portion" |
| **Line charts** | Trends over time | Adverbs: "rapidly," "steadily," "gradually" |

### The Five Data Slide Rules (Duarte)

1. **Tell the Truth**: Treat data with integrity; avoid decoration that obscures
2. **Get to the Point**: Data slides are about meaning, not data itself
3. **Pick the Right Tool**: Match chart type to your conclusion
4. **Highlight What's Important**: Use color/annotations to draw attention
5. **Keep It Simple**: Eliminate visual junk

### Chart Makeover Checklist
- [ ] Remove 3D effects (distorts perception)
- [ ] Remove decorative gradients
- [ ] Minimize gridlines (light gray if needed)
- [ ] Add clear, factual title
- [ ] Add observation (your interpretation) above title
- [ ] Highlight key data point with color
- [ ] Ensure legend is clear
- [ ] Test in grayscale (1 in 12 people are colorblind)

### Annotations
Don't let charts speak for themselves—annotate:
- Highlight specific data points with circles/arrows
- Add math (percentage changes, comparisons)
- Use callout boxes to explain significance
- Place observation above the chart title

## Color Guidelines

### Color Schemes (from color wheel theory)

| Scheme | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Monochromatic** | Variations of one color | Clean, professional look |
| **Complementary** | Opposite colors on wheel | High contrast, maximum impact |
| **Analogous** | Adjacent colors on wheel | Harmonious, warm/cool feeling |

### Practical Color Rules
- Select 3-5 core colors plus one neutral and one highlight
- Neutral colors (grays, tans) aid visual hierarchy
- Highlight color for emphasis in charts and key text
- Test projection—colors look different projected
- Ensure sufficient contrast for colorblind viewers

### Background Decisions
- **Dark backgrounds**: Formal, dramatic, good for large venues
- **Light backgrounds**: Informal, bright, works for handouts

## Bullet Point Guidelines

### The Harsh Truth
> "Bullet points are the least memorable way to transfer information." — Gallo

### If You Must Use Bullets
- Maximum 3-4 items
- Begin each with same grammatical structure (parallel construction)
- One line per bullet (no wrapping)
- Consider replacing with:
  - A single powerful image
  - A quote
  - A full-screen number
  - A simple diagram

### The Alternative: Progressive Reveal
Instead of showing all bullets at once:
1. Show slide with first point only
2. Click to reveal next point
3. Discuss each before revealing next

## The Lessig Method

Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig uses an alternative approach:
- 200+ slides for a presentation
- 1 big idea per slide
- Slides advance every few seconds
- Creates rapid, cinematic pacing

**When to use**: Dynamic keynotes, TED-style talks, engaging large audiences

---

## Animation Guidelines

### Good Uses of Animation
- Progressive reveal of complex diagrams
- Step-by-step process illustration
- Building a chart over time
- Emphasizing a key point

### Animation Mistakes to Avoid
- Dissolves, spins, bounces, or fancy transitions
- Animation "just because"
- Frenetic, distracting pace
- Startling surprises
- Every element animating separately

**Rule**: If the animation doesn't add meaning, remove it.
